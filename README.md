# Online-Learning-website

The online learning website is a platform that provides educational resources, courses, and programs that can be accessed through the internet. These websites allow learners to access a wide range of materials including video lectures, online textbooks, quizzes, assessments, and interactive multimedia content. Some online learning websites may offer courses for free, while others require a fee or subscription for access to their content. 

- My website uses frontend technologies such as: HTML, CSS, JS.
- As for the backend: it uses JSP Servlet, Microsoft SQL Server, Java and supporting libraries.

- The detailed information and project setup have been written in my final word. The remaining reports are the timeline and schedule of the project for 3 months.
